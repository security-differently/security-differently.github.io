I spoke at SREcon in March 2025! A recording of my talk is available on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjJdB2ZMxe0), and more information, including slides, can be found on the SREcon [program page](https://www.usenix.org/conference/srecon25americas/presentation/benninghoff).

**Abstract:**

There is significant overlap between Cybersecurity and SRE; understanding and leveraging that can improve the performance of both. Lessons from safety science tell us that security and SRE come through being successful more often, not failing less. Research in DevOps, Software Security, and elsewhere shows a strong link between different types of organizational performance, including development, operations, SRE, and security; in many cases, organizations most effectively reduce cybersecurity risk by improving general technology performance.

Many SRE capabilities overlap with Security, including the critical activities of patching & managing attack surface, along with observability, incident response, postmortems, testing, and platform engineering. SRE and Security teams can collaborate by supporting their mutual goals, sharing their perspectives dealing with incidents both frequent and rare, and by setting Security Level Objectives to inform decisions on when to divert resources to security as SRE teams do with Service Level Objectives.
