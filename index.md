intro-title: A Positive Approach to <em>Cybersecurity</em>
intro-content: <p>Instead of telling people what they <em>can’t</em> do, we integrate security into how work gets done in your organization, building on your strengths and improving your security performance, so that you are prepared when your systems are (inevitably) attacked.</p><p>A positive approach to cybersecurity improves organizational performance, employee engagement, learning and resilience. We adapt the latest data-driven research to your operations so that you can successfully prevent, detect, respond, and recover from security incidents.</p><p><a href="#contact">Contact Us</a> to learn more about how you can do more with your security investments!</p>

core-principle-title: Our Core Principles
core-principle-one: <h4><em>Learning</em> over compliance.</h4><p>Promote good outcomes and behaviors instead of preventing bad outcomes and behaviors.</p>
core-principle-two: <h4>Security <em>is a shared responsibility.</em></h4><p>The security team doesn’t create security.</p>
core-principle-summary: <p>Security Differently is a new evidence-based cybersecurity practice adapted from safety. By shifting the focus from preventing incidents to improving performance, security changes from a cost to an investment that can be measured directly.</p>

services-title: Services
service-one: <h4>Assessments</h4><p>How do you measure your security performance? Not experiencing a breach or a security incident isn’t a good measure, but in the past few years we’ve started to understand what practices and controls improve security. Our security assessment will review your software development and technology operations holistically, providing a detailed report on what your organization does well and what can be improved.</p>
service-two: <h4>Audit Assessments</h4><p>Concerned about passing an audit? We can help you identify what you’re already doing that satisfies your client, partner, or regulator, and build new security to close any gaps.</p>
service-three: <h4>Risk Qualification</h4><p>Have a legacy system you’re struggling to upgrade or replace? A risk quantification analysis can help your organization understand the financial impact of the security, availability, and business risks inherent in your system.</p>
service-four: <h4>Consulting</h4><p>Need something else? We can be your trusted advisor to help you develop and execute a security strategy that meets your needs.</p>
