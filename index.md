title: A Positive Approach to Cybersecurity
---
Instead of telling people what they *can't* do, we integrate security into how work gets done in your organization, building on your strengths and improving your security performance, so that you are prepared when your systems are (inevitably) attacked.

A positive approach to cybersecurity improves organizational performance, employee engagement, learning and resilience. We adapt the latest data-driven research to your operations so that you can successfully prevent, detect, respond, and recover from security incidents.
